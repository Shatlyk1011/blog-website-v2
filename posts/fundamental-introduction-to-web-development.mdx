## Networking Fundamentals

### Internet

The **Internet** is a global network of computers used to exchange data.  
It provides access to information, services, and communication across the world.

### Server

A **server** is a machine that provides services to other programs or devices, known as **clients**.  
Its role is to share data, resources, and distribute workloads.

**Types of servers:**

- Web servers
- Database servers
- DNS servers

### Web Server

A **web server** accepts HTTP requests from clients (browsers) and sends back HTTP responses containing HTML pages, images, files, and other resources.

### Domain & IP Address

A **domain** is a memorable, human-friendly address used to access websites. Without domains, you’d have to remember complex IP addresses.

An **IP address** is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to the internet.  
It works like a postal address, helping devices find each other and exchange information.

> IP addresses are organized hierarchically (country → region → device) to optimize routing speed.

### DNS & DNS Lookup

**DNS** (Domain Name System) — acts like the internet’s phonebook, translating domain names into IP addresses.

For example, using the IP [142.250.190.78](http://142.250.190.78/) or the domain [google.com](https://google.com) will take you to the same website — Google’s homepage.

**DNS lookup** is the process of finding the IP address of a server using its domain name (e.g., `example.com` → `93.184.216.34`).

##### How it works

1. **DNS Request:** The browser sends a request to a DNS server to get the IP address of the domain.
2. **Caching:** Once fetched, the IP address is stored in the browser’s cache to speed up future visits.
3. **Multiple Hosts:** If a webpage loads resources from multiple domains (e.g., fonts, images, or scripts), the browser performs a DNS lookup for each domain.

**Real-world example:**  
If your webpage loads Google Fonts, the browser will perform a DNS lookup not only for your site’s domain but also for `fonts.googleapis.com`.

### CDN — Content Delivery Network

A CDN is a network of servers distributed globally that stores copies of website content (pages, images, videos) and delivers them from the closest server to the user.

**Benefits:**

- Faster load times
- Reduced server load
- Better reliability

**Real-world example:**  
Netflix uses CDNs to stream video from a nearby server, so you don’t have to wait for data to travel halfway across the world.

## Browser — Introduction

A browser is software that allows a user to access information on the internet via the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web).

In modern web development, knowing how browsers operate can make your websites faster, more accessible, and more reliable.

### How the Browser Loads a Web Page

Navigation is the first step in loading a web page.

![pc server interaction](/static/browser-navigation.png)

When you type a `URL` into the browser's address bar, you’re directing your browser to connect to a specific **web server**.

The server processes your request and sends a response containing files like `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, along with media such as images and videos. If everything is fine, the server responds with a **200 OK** status code.

> The first request from a browser to a web server is always a **GET** request — a common interview question for junior developers.

### Request, Response, Parsing, Rendering

#### Request

The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS **GET request** to the server for the page’s content.

#### Response

The server (or CDN) returns data — HTML, CSS, JS, images — which the browser processes.

#### Parsing

Parsing is converting the HTML into a format the browser can understand — the **DOM (Document Object Model)**.

- **CSS** is parsed into **CSSOM (CSS Object Model)**.
- **JavaScript** without `async` or `defer` stops HTML parsing until the script loads and runs.
- **Render tree** combines DOM + CSSOM for display.
- Non-blocking resources (images, videos) load in parallel.

The browser also builds an **Accessibility Tree**, which is essential for assistive technologies like screen readers.

### Rendering

Rendering is turning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a visual webpage.

1. **Styles:** DOM and CSSOM merge into a render tree of visible elements.
2. **Layout:** Browser calculates size and position (box model: content, padding, border, margin).
3. **Painting:** Browser draws pixels — text, images, colors.
4. **Interactivity:** JavaScript loads, enabling scroll, clicks, and animations.

## TTI — Time To Interactive

**TTI (Time To Interactive)** measures how long it takes from the first request (starting with DNS lookup) until the page becomes fully interactive.

- Shorter TTI = better user experience.
- Test your site’s TTI with [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/).

## Summary

- **Domain & IP:** Human-friendly name + unique numeric address for devices.
- **DNS Lookup:** Translates domain names to IP addresses; caching speeds up repeat visits.
- **CDN:** Speeds up content delivery using global servers.
- **Navigation:** Entering a URL sends a GET request; server responds with page files.
- **Request/Response:** Browser requests data; server returns HTML, CSS, JS, and media.
- **Parsing:** HTML → DOM, CSS → CSSOM, combined into a render tree.
- **Rendering:** Calculates styles, layout, and draws the page.
- **TTI:** Time until a page is fully usable.
